# Biblionaut

EPUB reader firmware for the Xteink X4 (ESP32-C3, 800x480 e-ink, SD card),
written so that everything except the hardware layer also builds and runs on
a desktop.

## Layout

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| `core/` | Shared foundation: arenas, the timing trace, counters and gauges, the framed diagnostic stream, checksums, the heap-failure hook, and the interfaces the portable parts use to reach the outside world (clock, byte source, byte sink, display, buttons) |
| `hw/` | Hardware abstraction layer. `hw/include` is the interface. `hw/desktop` implements it for the host; on a device, `hw/esp32c3` holds what the chip provides and `hw/x4` what is specific to the X4 |
| `epub/` | Book parsing: zip, XML, OPF / TOC, CSS, the importer and the intermediate format |
| `draw/` | Fonts and drawing: glyphs, metrics, the display-list format, the band renderer, images |
| `layout/` | Book layout: line breaking, hyphenation, pagination, positions. Emits display lists |
| `reader/` | The reader application. The only part that knows about all the others |
| `app/` | Entry points: `app/desktop` for the host, and `app/firmware`, the ESP-IDF project that builds the one firmware image for all supported devices |
| `tools/` | Host programs (`tools/trace`: the `bn-trace` stream decoder) and developer scripts (`bn-symbolize` for crash reports) |
| `tests/` | Host tests |
| `corpus/` | Test books |

Dependency rules, enforced by the build (each part has its own include
directory and can only see the parts it links):

```
reader  ->  layout, draw, epub, hw
layout  ->  draw, epub
epub, layout, draw  ->  core        (never hw)
hw                  ->  core
```

Only code under `hw/` and `app/firmware` may include ESP-IDF or FreeRTOS headers.

The code is C++20 with exceptions and RTTI disabled, so anything that throws
ends in an abort. The portable parts (`core`, `epub`, `draw`, `layout`) are
held to more: they allocate from arenas, not the general heap, and call
nothing that can throw, so every failure reaches their caller as a return
value. `reader` and `hw` may use the general heap and the standard library's
allocating types where that is the simpler choice.

Naming: namespaces are `snake_case`; classes, structs and functions are
`PascalCase`; variables, parameters and members are `camelCase`, with a
trailing underscore on private members; constants are `kPascalCase`.
clang-tidy enforces this.

## Host build

Needs CMake 3.25 or later, Ninja and a C++20 compiler. GoogleTest is
downloaded when CMake configures.

```
cmake --preset host
cmake --build --preset host
ctest --preset host
./build/host/app/desktop/biblionaut-desktop
```

The `host` preset is a debug build with AddressSanitizer and
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. `host-release` is optimised, without sanitizers.

How much timing trace is compiled in is set with `BN_TRACE_LEVEL`: `0` for
none, `1` for top-level spans only, `2` (the default) for everything. Pass it
when configuring, for example `cmake --preset host -DBN_TRACE_LEVEL=0` or
`tools/idf -DBN_TRACE_LEVEL=1 build`.

## Diagnostic stream

The application sends trace records, log text and metrics over its serial
line as binary frames (`core/frame.h`): the USB port on a device. On the
desktop the same stream goes to the file named by `BN_SERIAL_OUT`:

```
BN_SERIAL_OUT=run.bin ./build/host/app/desktop/biblionaut-desktop --run-ms 5000
```

Frames are delimited by zero bytes, so they can share the line with plain
text such as boot messages. In a serial monitor the frames show up as short
bursts of unreadable bytes between the readable lines.

`bn-trace` (built with the host build) decodes the stream. It prints every
event as a line of text and can write a timeline to open at
[ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev) or `chrome://tracing`:

```
# A capture file from a desktop run
./build/host/tools/trace/bn-trace run.bin --out run.json

# The plugged-in device, live, until Ctrl-C
./build/host/tools/trace/bn-trace --out device.json --save device.bin
```

With no input named, `bn-trace` finds the USB serial device itself; name
the port (for example `/dev/cu.usbmodem101`) if more than one is plugged in.
It restarts the device first, so the capture begins with the boot messages
and the hello that names the firmware. `--no-reset` attaches without
restarting, and then shows whatever the device had buffered since something
last read it.

In the timeline each boot of the device is a process and each task a thread;
spans are slices, log lines are markers, and each counter and gauge is its
own graph. `--save` keeps the raw bytes so a capture can be decoded again
later.

Trace ids are turned back into names from the lists in each part's
`trace_ids.h`, which the tool is built from. A capture from newer firmware
than the tool shows ids it does not know as numbers.

## The panel and the buttons

The e-ink panel's controller keeps two full images in its own memory, and
the firmware keeps none: pictures are rendered a band of rows at a time and
written straight to the controller (`core/display.h`). `hw/x4` drives the
X4's panel.

The devices have seven buttons. Six of them share two analogue pins and
cannot raise an interrupt, so `hw/x4` reads them every 5 ms and turns the
readings into events: pressed, released, held (`core/input.h`). An event
carries the time the change was first seen.

Until there are pages to show, the application shows a test pattern and the
buttons step through its four pictures (`reader/pattern_viewer.h`):

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| Down, Right | The next picture, by a fast refresh |
| Up, Left | The previous picture, by a fast refresh |
| Confirm | The same picture again, by a half refresh |
| Back | The same picture again, by a full refresh |

The pattern is in the panel's own orientation, which on the X4 is with the
device turned a quarter-turn anticlockwise from the way a book is read.

The trace of a press runs from the button to the panel:

```
task 1  hw/button_press button=5          the button going down, first reading to settled
task 0  reader/press_to_refresh button=5  from the button going down to the refresh being started
interrupts  hw/refresh_fast               the panel's own time
task 0  reader/panel_sweep picture=3      the picture after, rendered and sent ahead of the next press
```

The picture a press asks for is usually in the panel already, written
there after the last refresh, so the press has only to start the refresh.

On the desktop a simulation stands in for the panel, working out what a
real one would show after each refresh, including the stale pixels a fast
refresh leaves if the two images are allowed to fall out of step. Buttons
are scripted. Three environment variables control them:

```
BN_DISPLAY_OUT=panel BN_INPUT=4000:down,5000:down,6000:confirm \
  ./build/host/app/desktop/biblionaut-desktop --run-ms 9000
open panel-001.png          # one picture per refresh
```

- `BN_DISPLAY_OUT=prefix` saves what the panel shows at every refresh, as
  `prefix-001.png`, `prefix-002.png` and so on.
- `BN_INPUT` presses buttons: `milliseconds:button`, with an optional third
  field for how long the button is held (`5000:power:1500`). The buttons
  are `back`, `confirm`, `left`, `right`, `up`, `down` and `power`.
- `BN_DISPLAY_SPEED=20` makes the simulated panel twenty times quicker than
  a real one, which takes 3.6 s over a full refresh.

### The panel's two planes

The panel's controller keeps two images, and a fast refresh works from
both: the new image, and the old one it is to change from. On the X4 the
two change places by themselves after every fast refresh, and go back to
their first places when the panel's drive voltages are switched off.
`core/display.h` sets out the rules, which were found by reading the
planes back out of a device, and what they ask of whatever drives the
panel. The pattern viewer follows them: it writes the next picture ahead
of time, leaves the old image alone while the voltages are on, and writes
both again once they have been switched off. The simulated panel on the
desktop behaves the same way, so a mistake here shows in the tests.

A firmware built with `-DBN_PLANE_CHECK=ON` checks this on a device (on
the desktop, set `BN_PLANE_CHECK`). Whenever the panel comes to rest,
after a refresh and again after the voltages are switched off, both planes
are read back and the trace says what was found:

```
reader/new_plane_holds picture=3
reader/old_plane_holds picture=2
```

1 to 4 is that picture, 8 a blank plane and 9 anything else, in which case
a `new_plane_bands` or `old_plane_bands` line follows with a digit for each
band of 80 rows. The new-image plane should hold the picture after the one
on the panel, and the old-image plane the one on the panel. The metrics
count the readings and how many found otherwise:

```
plane_checks=14 planes_unexpected=0
```

Reading back takes about a second, a band at a time; a press during it is
acted on at once and the reading starts again when the panel is next at
rest. The first time anything is read, the controller's status byte and
display options are recorded too (`hw/panel_status`, `hw/panel_options`).

```
tools/idf -DBN_PLANE_CHECK=ON build flash
./build/host/tools/trace/bn-trace | tee planes.log
tools/idf -DBN_PLANE_CHECK=OFF build flash     # back to the normal firmware
```

## Storage

Files are reached through three things in `core`:

- `core/storage.h` is the bare interface a hardware port implements: open,
  read and write at an offset, sync, and the handful of calls that work on
  names. Every call says how it ended (`StorageStatus`), and every port
  accepts the same paths, which are the ones an SD card can hold.
- `core/block_file.h` is what code reads and writes files with. It keeps a
  position and a buffer of its own, asks storage for whole blocks at
  multiples of the block size, and counts what it asks for (`sd_reads`,
  `sd_read_bytes`, `sd_seeks`, `sd_writes`, `sd_write_bytes`, `sd_syncs`).
  It is also a `ByteSource`, so a parser can read a file without knowing it
  is one.
- `core/file_replacement.h` writes a file so that it is never found half
  written, whenever the power goes. An SD card cannot put one file in the
  place of another in one step, so it takes several, and
  `RecoverReplacement()` finishes or undoes whatever was cut short.

On a device the card is on the wires it shares with the panel, driven by
ESP-IDF's SD driver and FatFS, which is called directly
(`hw/esp32c3/sd_storage.cpp`). Only FAT file systems are understood, which
is what cards of up to 32 GB are sold with; a bigger card comes with exFAT
and has to be formatted as FAT32 first.

On the desktop the card is a folder (`hw/desktop/folder_storage.h`), the
one named by the `BN_STORAGE` environment variable; without it there is no
card. It is made to behave as a card does where that is cheap: the same
paths are refused, only four files can be open at once, an open file
cannot be removed or renamed, and a rename will not replace a file.

The application gets storage ready at start and says whether it is
(`storage_ok` in the metrics, `reader/storage_start` in the trace). It
does nothing else with it yet. On a device the trace also says what was
found, and why not if nothing usable was:

```
hw/sd_card megabytes=30436          the card's size
hw/sd_file_system kind=3            1: FAT12, 2: FAT16, 3: FAT32
hw/sd_start status=0  312.5 ms      0: ready, 1: no card, 8: a card that cannot be used
hw/sd_card_error code=263           the card did not answer
hw/sd_mount_error code=13           no file system FatFS knows: exFAT, most likely
```

A firmware built with `-DBN_STORAGE_CHECK=ON` puts the card through its
paces (on the desktop, set `BN_STORAGE_CHECK`): at start, and again at each
press of the Power button, which also looks for a card again if none was
found before. It writes a 256 KB file in 4 KB blocks, reads it back
checking every byte, reads short pieces from all over it, replaces a small
file twice, and removes what it made (`reader/storage_check.h`). It does a
little each turn, so the panel and the buttons carry on around it. Each
read, write and sync of the card is in the trace with the time it took
(`hw/sd_read`, `hw/sd_write`, `hw/sd_sync`), and the outcome is there and
in the metrics:

```
reader/storage_check passed=1
reader/storage_check_failed step_and_status=307     step 3 (writing), status 7 (no space)
storage_check=1[1..1]
```

```
tools/idf -DBN_STORAGE_CHECK=ON build flash
./build/host/tools/trace/bn-trace | tee card.log
tools/idf -DBN_STORAGE_CHECK=OFF build flash     # back to the normal firmware
```

It can be combined with `-DBN_PLANE_CHECK=ON`, to see whether using the
card disturbs what the panel holds.

## Device build

The firmware builds with ESP-IDF. A setup script installs the pinned version
and its compiler into `.esp/` inside this repository (a download of a few
gigabytes, ignored by git); nothing is installed elsewhere.

```
tools/setup-idf.sh          # once
tools/idf build
tools/idf flash monitor
```

`tools/idf` runs `idf.py` on `app/firmware` with that local install, and
passes its arguments through.

Flashing replaces whatever firmware is on the device, including its
bootloader and partition table.

## Crash reports

When the firmware stops unexpectedly (a processor fault, `abort()`, a failed
assertion, running out of memory, a stack overflow), ESP-IDF prints what it
knows on the console and restarts the device. Before that happens the
firmware saves a report of its own: the reason, the task, the registers, the
top of the stack and the last 32 trace records. The report sits in memory
that survives a restart, and every later start sends it on the diagnostic
stream, until the device loses power or crashes again. So after a crash,
plug the device in and run `bn-trace`: the report is the first thing after
the boot.

The report gives addresses. `tools/bn-symbolize` turns them into functions
and source lines:

```
./build/host/tools/trace/bn-trace | tools/bn-symbolize
./build/host/tools/trace/bn-trace capture.bin | tools/bn-symbolize
tools/bn-symbolize 0x4200614a
```

Addresses only mean something for the exact build that crashed. Every
firmware build keeps a copy of its ELF file in `.elf-archive/` (ignored by
git, the newest 40 are kept), named by its SHA-256; a report carries the
start of that hash, and `bn-symbolize` uses it to pick the right file. If a
report comes from a build that is not in the archive, its addresses are left
alone; `--elf FILE` names a file to use regardless.

To see a report without waiting for a bug, build a firmware that crashes on
purpose ten seconds after it starts:

```
tools/idf -DBN_CRASH_TEST=fault build flash     # or abort, oom, stack
./build/host/tools/trace/bn-trace | tools/bn-symbolize
tools/idf -DBN_CRASH_TEST= build flash          # back to the normal firmware
```

It does not crash again on the restart that follows a crash. On the desktop,
`BN_FAKE_CRASH=1` makes the application start with an invented report, which
exercises everything after the crash itself.

## Checks

CI runs all of these on every push to `main` and every pull request
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). To run them locally:

| Check | Command |
|---|---|
| Unit tests, with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer | `cmake --build --preset host && ctest --preset host` |
| The same tests as CI's Linux job runs them: GCC 14 on Ubuntu, in Docker | `tools/linux-check.sh` (arguments go to `ctest`) |
| Formatting | `tools/check-format.sh` (`--fix` to rewrite files) |
| Constructs the portable parts may not use (`std::string`, `std::vector`, `std::function`, `std::shared_ptr`, iostreams, C stdio streams) | `tools/check-banned.py` |
| clang-tidy (rules in `.clang-tidy`) on everything the host build compiles | `cmake --preset tidy && cmake --build --preset tidy` |
| clang-tidy on what the firmware build compiles: the device code, and the portable parts as built for the device | `tools/check-firmware-tidy.py` (after a firmware build) |
| Firmware builds | `tools/idf build` |
| The portable parts (`core`, `epub`, `draw`, `layout`) call nothing that can throw | `tools/check-firmware-symbols.sh` (after a firmware build) |

The formatting check and both clang-tidy runs need the LLVM major version
named in `tools/llvm-version` (`brew install llvm@<version>` on macOS).

Two clang-tidy runs, because no single build compiles everything. The host
run sees the portable parts, the desktop port, the tools and the tests, and
leaves the Clang Static Analyzer out for the tests (`tests/.clang-tidy` says
why). The firmware run sees the device code under `hw/` and
`app/firmware`, which nothing else checks, by translating the firmware's
GCC compile commands into ones clang can use.

The Linux run is worth doing before pushing changes to how memory is
handled. Its compiler and C library catch faults the macOS build cannot see,
such as a null pointer passed to `memset` with a length of zero, and under
the sanitizers a finding fails the test.
