# Biblionaut

EPUB reader firmware for the Xteink X4 (ESP32-C3, 800x480 e-ink, SD card),
written so that everything except the hardware layer also builds and runs on
a desktop.

## Layout

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| `core/` | Shared foundation: arenas, the timing trace, counters and gauges, the framed diagnostic stream, checksums, the heap-failure hook, and the interfaces the portable parts use to reach the outside world (clock, byte source, byte sink) |
| `hw/` | Hardware abstraction layer. `hw/include` is the interface. `hw/desktop` implements it for the host; on a device, `hw/esp32c3` holds what the chip provides and `hw/x4` what is specific to the X4 |
| `epub/` | Book parsing: zip, XML, OPF / TOC, CSS, the importer and the intermediate format |
| `draw/` | Fonts and drawing: glyphs, metrics, the display-list format, the band renderer, images |
| `layout/` | Book layout: line breaking, hyphenation, pagination, positions. Emits display lists |
| `reader/` | The reader application. The only part that knows about all the others |
| `app/` | Entry points: `app/desktop` for the host, and `app/firmware`, the ESP-IDF project that builds the one firmware image for all supported devices |
| `tools/` | Host programs (`tools/trace`: the `bn-trace` stream decoder) and developer scripts (`bn-symbolize` for crash reports) |
| `tests/` | Host tests |
| `corpus/` | Test books |

Dependency rules, enforced by the build (each part has its own include
directory and can only see the parts it links):

```
reader  ->  layout, draw, epub, hw
layout  ->  draw, epub
epub, layout, draw  ->  core        (never hw)
hw                  ->  core
```

Only code under `hw/` and `app/firmware` may include ESP-IDF or FreeRTOS headers.

The code is C++20 with exceptions and RTTI disabled, so anything that throws
ends in an abort. The portable parts (`core`, `epub`, `draw`, `layout`) are
held to more: they allocate from arenas, not the general heap, and call
nothing that can throw, so every failure reaches their caller as a return
value. `reader` and `hw` may use the general heap and the standard library's
allocating types where that is the simpler choice.

Naming: namespaces are `snake_case`; classes, structs and functions are
`PascalCase`; variables, parameters and members are `camelCase`, with a
trailing underscore on private members; constants are `kPascalCase`.
clang-tidy enforces this.

## Host build

Needs CMake 3.25 or later, Ninja and a C++20 compiler. GoogleTest is
downloaded when CMake configures.

```
cmake --preset host
cmake --build --preset host
ctest --preset host
./build/host/app/desktop/biblionaut-desktop
```

The `host` preset is a debug build with AddressSanitizer and
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. `host-release` is optimised, without sanitizers.

How much timing trace is compiled in is set with `BN_TRACE_LEVEL`: `0` for
none, `1` for top-level spans only, `2` (the default) for everything. Pass it
when configuring, for example `cmake --preset host -DBN_TRACE_LEVEL=0` or
`tools/idf -DBN_TRACE_LEVEL=1 build`.

## Diagnostic stream

The application sends trace records, log text and metrics over its serial
line as binary frames (`core/frame.h`): the USB port on a device. On the
desktop the same stream goes to the file named by `BN_SERIAL_OUT`:

```
BN_SERIAL_OUT=run.bin ./build/host/app/desktop/biblionaut-desktop --run-ms 5000
```

Frames are delimited by zero bytes, so they can share the line with plain
text such as boot messages. In a serial monitor the frames show up as short
bursts of unreadable bytes between the readable lines.

`bn-trace` (built with the host build) decodes the stream. It prints every
event as a line of text and can write a timeline to open at
[ui.perfetto.dev](https://ui.perfetto.dev) or `chrome://tracing`:

```
# A capture file from a desktop run
./build/host/tools/trace/bn-trace run.bin --out run.json

# The plugged-in device, live, until Ctrl-C
./build/host/tools/trace/bn-trace --out device.json --save device.bin
```

With no input named, `bn-trace` finds the USB serial device itself; name
the port (for example `/dev/cu.usbmodem101`) if more than one is plugged in.
It restarts the device first, so the capture begins with the boot messages
and the hello that names the firmware. `--no-reset` attaches without
restarting, and then shows whatever the device had buffered since something
last read it.

In the timeline each boot of the device is a process and each task a thread;
spans are slices, log lines are markers, and each counter and gauge is its
own graph. `--save` keeps the raw bytes so a capture can be decoded again
later.

Trace ids are turned back into names from the lists in each part's
`trace_ids.h`, which the tool is built from. A capture from newer firmware
than the tool shows ids it does not know as numbers.

## Device build

The firmware builds with ESP-IDF. A setup script installs the pinned version
and its compiler into `.esp/` inside this repository (a download of a few
gigabytes, ignored by git); nothing is installed elsewhere.

```
tools/setup-idf.sh          # once
tools/idf build
tools/idf flash monitor
```

`tools/idf` runs `idf.py` on `app/firmware` with that local install, and
passes its arguments through.

Flashing replaces whatever firmware is on the device, including its
bootloader and partition table.

## Crash reports

When the firmware stops unexpectedly (a processor fault, `abort()`, a failed
assertion, running out of memory, a stack overflow), ESP-IDF prints what it
knows on the console and restarts the device. Before that happens the
firmware saves a report of its own: the reason, the task, the registers, the
top of the stack and the last 32 trace records. The report sits in memory
that survives a restart, and every later start sends it on the diagnostic
stream, until the device loses power or crashes again. So after a crash,
plug the device in and run `bn-trace`: the report is the first thing after
the boot.

The report gives addresses. `tools/bn-symbolize` turns them into functions
and source lines:

```
./build/host/tools/trace/bn-trace | tools/bn-symbolize
./build/host/tools/trace/bn-trace capture.bin | tools/bn-symbolize
tools/bn-symbolize 0x4200614a
```

Addresses only mean something for the exact build that crashed. Every
firmware build keeps a copy of its ELF file in `.elf-archive/` (ignored by
git, the newest 40 are kept), named by its SHA-256; a report carries the
start of that hash, and `bn-symbolize` uses it to pick the right file. If a
report comes from a build that is not in the archive, its addresses are left
alone; `--elf FILE` names a file to use regardless.

To see a report without waiting for a bug, build a firmware that crashes on
purpose ten seconds after it starts:

```
tools/idf -DBN_CRASH_TEST=fault build flash     # or abort, oom, stack
./build/host/tools/trace/bn-trace | tools/bn-symbolize
tools/idf -DBN_CRASH_TEST= build flash          # back to the normal firmware
```

It does not crash again on the restart that follows a crash. On the desktop,
`BN_FAKE_CRASH=1` makes the application start with an invented report, which
exercises everything after the crash itself.

## Checks

CI runs all of these on every push to `main` and every pull request
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). To run them locally:

| Check | Command |
|---|---|
| Unit tests, with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer | `cmake --build --preset host && ctest --preset host` |
| Formatting | `tools/check-format.sh` (`--fix` to rewrite files) |
| Constructs the portable parts may not use (`std::string`, `std::vector`, `std::function`, `std::shared_ptr`, iostreams, C stdio streams) | `tools/check-banned.py` |
| clang-tidy (rules in `.clang-tidy`) | `cmake --preset tidy && cmake --build --preset tidy` |
| Firmware builds | `tools/idf build` |
| The portable parts (`core`, `epub`, `draw`, `layout`) call nothing that can throw | `tools/check-firmware-symbols.sh` (after a firmware build) |

The formatting check and clang-tidy need the LLVM major version named in
`tools/llvm-version` (`brew install llvm@<version>` on macOS).
